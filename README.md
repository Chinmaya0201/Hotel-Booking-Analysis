## Hotel Booking and Cancelation Analysis

The Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis project aims to analyze the patterns and factors contributing to hotel booking cancellations. With the increasing popularity of online hotel booking platforms, understanding the reasons behind cancellations can provide valuable insights to hotel managers and help optimize revenue management strategies.

This project leverages the power of Python and various libraries to perform comprehensive analysis on a dataset containing hotel booking information.
The key Python libraries used in this project include:

Pandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library that provides high-performance data structures and tools for data analysis. It allows for efficient handling, cleaning, and preprocessing of the hotel booking dataset.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is a widely used plotting library that enables the creation of various types of visualizations. It allows for the generation of insightful graphs, charts, and plots to visualize trends and patterns in hotel booking cancellations.

Seaborn: Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating aesthetically pleasing statistical graphics. Seaborn enhances the visual appeal and readability of the generated plots.

### Hypothesis

1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. When there is a longer waiting list, customers tend to cancel more frequently.
3. The majority of clients are coming from ofï¬‚ine travel agents to make their reservations.
